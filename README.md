## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for development setup and workflow. This extension is still in development and open to help!

## Repository Notes

- The `.copilot` path is a developer-facing Git submodule used for local authoring support.
- It is excluded from the published VSIX and is not required at runtime by the extension.
- Treat the submodule as separate supply-chain scope and review it independently before enabling recursive checkout in any downstream automation.
